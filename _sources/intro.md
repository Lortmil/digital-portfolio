:::{tab-item} Things I learned
:sync: tab1
- While making this assignment I found it very useful to understand how to make my Jupyter Notebooks look clean and well laid out. Using grids, cards, tables, and references will go a long way in making my future books make the biggest impact.
- I learned how to hide the code that I do not want the reader to see, either because it is long or because it distrubs the readers flow.
- I learned to link documents to the main notebook so as to cross-reference images or other notebooks.
